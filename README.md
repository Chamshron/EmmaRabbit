# EmmaRabbit
I like the Lucky Emma Rabbit blind boxes however, as there are multiple series, as well as rare versions of figures, I wanted to create an app where I could track this.

Java back-end with MongoDB, React front-end.

MVP:
 * User should be able to see select a series of Lucky Emma Rabbits and see the figures that are part of the series.
 * User should be able to check whether or not they have gotten a certain figure as part of the series

 Next steps:
  * I would like to use a Java template
