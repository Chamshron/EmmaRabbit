# EmmaRabbit
I like the Lucky Emma Rabbit blind boxes however, as there are multiple series, as well as rare versions of figures, I wanted to create an app where I could track this. Link: https://www.luckyemma.com/product/emma-secret-forest-dim-lights-series/

Java back-end with MongoDB, React front-end.

MVP:
 * User should be able to see select a series of Lucky Emma Rabbits and see the figures that are part of the series.
 * User should be able to check whether or not they have gotten a certain figure as part of the series


 Next steps:
  * Back-end wise, I would like to use a Java template and make the Rabbit class more complex, potentially having a tracker for what percentage of a certain series and overall I have obtained of the collectable figures
  * Front-end wise, I would like to use TailWindCSS and some animation it astectically pleasing.
